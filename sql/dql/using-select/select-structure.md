# SELECT Structure


---

## Content

Let's quickly go over how queries are structured.

Consider the following table, `pokemon`:

| id | name      | type_1 | type_2 |
| -- | --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1  | Bulbasaur | Grass  | Poison |
| 2  | Ivysaur   | Grass  | Poison |
| 3  | Venusaur  | Grass  | Poison |

To return all the data in this table, you'd use:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pokemon;
```

The query above:

1. `SELECT`s, 
2. all the columns (represented by the `*` symbol), 
3. in the order of their definition in the database, 
4. `FROM` the `pokemon` table. 

The returned table will contain all of the *columns* and all of the *rows* from the table.

> ðŸ’¡ All the SQL keywords like `SELECT` and `FROM` **are case insensitive**, so the code below also works.

```sql
select *
from pokemon;
```

The keywords are usually capitalized simply to make the code easier to read.

## Practice

Complete the query to select the `id` and `name` columns from the `pokemon` table:

```sql
??? id, ??? 
??? pokemon
```

- SELECT
- name
- FROM
- RETURN
- id
- pokemon
