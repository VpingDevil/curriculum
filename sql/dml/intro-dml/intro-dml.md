## Content

Up until now, you've just learned how to query data from a database or table.

SQL has three main parts:

- Data **Query** Language (**DQL**): this part deals with extracting information from a database
- Data **Manipulation** Language (**DML**): this part deals with updating information in a database
- Data **Definition** Language (**DDL**): this part deals with creating databases/tables and changing their schema

In this course, we'll talk about **DML**. 

Manipulation includes concepts such as:

- inserting
- updating
- deleting
