# DELETE

## Content

What if you don't like raspberries as well, but you also don't want to replace it with another fruit?

Introducing the `DELETE` keyword. With it, you can remove entire records from your table.

Using the table from the previous insight[1], we would write:

```sql
DELETE FROM 
  fruits
WHERE 
  name = 'Raspberry';
```

That's it, no more raspberries:

| id | name  |
| -- | ----- |
| 2  | Grape |

> ðŸ’¡ This is a short introduction to the `DELETE` keyword. We'll explain how everything works in the following workouts.
