# UPDATE


---

## Content

On second thought, you realize that you don't enjoy pineapples that much.

Using the same `fruits` table:

| id | name      |
| -- | --------- |
| 1  | Raspberry |
| 2  | Pineapple |

Let's see how you can update the `Pineapple` entry to `Grape`.

Updating is done through, no points for guessing, the `UPDATE` keyword:

```sql
UPDATE 
  fruits
SET 
  name = 'Grape'
WHERE 
  id = 2
```

Done ðŸŽ‰. The `fruits` table now looks like this:

| id | name      |
| -- | --------- |
| 1  | Raspberry |
| 2  | Grape     |

> ðŸ’¡ This is a short introduction to the `UPDATE` keyword. We'll explain how everything works in the following workouts.
