Let's see how you can handle manipulating data!

Consider the following `movies` table:

| id | name                                     | year | rating |
|----|------------------------------------------|------|--------|
| 1  | Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban | 2004 | 7.9    |
| 2  | Parasite                                 | 2019 | 8.6    |
| 3  | The Dark Knight                          | 2008 | 9      |
| 4  | Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse        | 2018 | 8.4    |
| 6  | Goodfellas                               | 1990 | 8.7    |

How would you update the rating of any of the movies?

It's up to you to choose the movie and its new rating.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- updating data (`UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...`)

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

To update the values in a table, start by writing `UPDATE table_name`.

Then, using the `SET` keyword you can change the values found in columns.

Finally, use the `WHERE` keyword to specify which records should be updated:

```sql
UPDATE movies
SET
  name = "My Movie",
  year = 2020,
  rating = 7
WHERE
  id = 1;
```
