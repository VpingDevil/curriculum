# Distinction Between Stack and Heap Memory


---

## Content

**Stack** and **heap** are both types of memory, but have different purposes and uses within a program.

**Heap memory** is used to store objects and **JRE** classes. 

**Stack memory** is used to store local variables, method calls, and references to the objects stored in **heap memory**.

Each thread has its own stack, and variables stored in a stack are only visible to that stack's owner. 

Heap memory is shared among all threads.

If there is no available stack memory left, then a `java.lang.StackOverFlowError` error will be thrown.

If there is a lack of heap space, then a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space` error will be thrown.
