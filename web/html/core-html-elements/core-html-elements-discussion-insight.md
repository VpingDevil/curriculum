## Content

Now that you've learned some HTML, it's time to try it out!

Can you write HTML code for a webpage that would display:
- The largest heading containing the title of the page
- An image of any size. To be nice to your viewers add an alternative text message in case the image cannot load.
- One paragraph with information about the page.
- A link to another website

It's up to you to choose the title, the image, what the contents of those paragraphs will be, as well as their color.

Here's one example of how the page can look:

For bonus points try and style the paragraphs and/or headings in a different color.

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

## Footnotes
[1: Hints]

> Here are some examples on how you can style your elements:

Chaining css properties together.

```css
<element style="property1:value1;property2:value2">
  Some text
</element> 
```

Styling multiple elements at once:

```css
<style>
element1, element2 {
 property_name: value
}
</style>
```
