# How to Change Chart Data


---

## Content
 
There might be times when you want to add more data to your chart after creating it.

To do this you need to open the `Chart editor` and click on the `Select data range` button.

Next, a pop-up window will appear.

Click on the `Add another range` button and select the cells you want to add to your chart.

Now that you've added the data, you need to display it in the chart.

Go to the `Chart editor` and under the `Series` tab add the new data.

> ðŸ’¡ You can also add data from a different sheet. The process is completely the same. 

After you click on the `Add another range` button you can navigate to any sheet and select the data you want to import. 

> ðŸ’¡ The data range will start with the name of the sheet before the cells to identify from which sheet the cells are coming from.
