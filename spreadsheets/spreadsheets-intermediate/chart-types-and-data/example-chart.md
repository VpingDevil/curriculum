## Content

Charts are a great way of visualizing data.
 
Let's say we have a table spanning over three years, with an `Employee of the month` column.

We can use a chart to see who was the `Employee of the month` the most:
- select the cells you want to include in your chart
- go to the `Insert` tab and click `Chart`
- select the chart you want
- tick the `Aggregate` button in the chart

Now, here is how the chart will look:

> ğŸ’¡ Hovering over a part of the chart will show the number of instances and the percentage.
