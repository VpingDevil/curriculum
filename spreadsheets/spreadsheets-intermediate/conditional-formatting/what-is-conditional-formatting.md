# What Is Conditional Formatting

---
## Content

Conditional formatting is a feature that allows you to create special formatting on a single cell or multiple cells to meet certain criteria.

It allows you to create different `if-then` conditions.

`if-then` are logical conditions that work like this: `If` "some condition" `then` do "something".
