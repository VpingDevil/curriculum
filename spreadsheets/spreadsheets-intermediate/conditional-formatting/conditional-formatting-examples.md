## Single Color Example

Here is a table that highlights dates using 3 different `single color` rules.

![single-color-example](https://img.enkipro.com/4f0e476b03b66149f518c653738d2605.png)

Rule 1: If a date is before 1/1/2014 the color of the cell will be red.

Rule 2: If a date is after 1/1/2015 the color of the cell will be green and the text will be bold.

Rule 3: If the cell is not empty, the color of the cell will be yellow.

## Color Scale Examples

Here is a table of grades for a student named `Richard` for 8 different classes.

We set up the color scale to work on percent values.

![color-scale-example](https://img.enkipro.com/8dff9f3d4d70e4554f5257aad2623cdb.png)

If the value of the cells in the `Grade` column is less than `70`, the color of the cell will go from yellow towards red (Fail). If the `Grade` is higher than `70` the value will go from yellow to green (Pass).

In the example, we have set `70` as the `Midpoint` because those classes require a grade of `70` and above to pass the class.
