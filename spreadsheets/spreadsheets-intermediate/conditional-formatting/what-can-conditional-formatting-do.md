# What Can Conditional Formatting Do

---
## Content

Conditional formatting is achieved through `rules`. 

> ðŸ’¡ Every rule will correspond to a single `if-then` condition.

You can create as many `rules` as you want.
 
For example, you can create `rules` that change the color of a cell to red if the value is a negative number and green if it is a positive number.

Different rules allow you to create different color-coding systems.

These rules are reactive to change. Anytime a cell value is updated you can apply formatting such color the text and/or cell, bold it, underline, and more, to it. 

Sheets come with some default conditions but you can also manually input formulas to create custom conditions yourself.
