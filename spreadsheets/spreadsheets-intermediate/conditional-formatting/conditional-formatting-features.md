The `Conditional formatting` tab is located under `Format` -> `Conditional formatting`.

After opening it, a new tab called `Conditional format rules` will appear on the right side of the sheet.

Here you have two tabs: `Single color` and `Color scale`. 

On the `Single color`, you can select the range of cells you want the rule to be applied on, what the rule is, the formatting style, and add a new rule.

You can select more than one range of cells or singular cells.

The `Format rules` bar has several pre-made conditions you can use.

At the top you have the `Is empty` & `Is not empty` conditions and five `text` related conditions.

Next, you have three `date` conditions, eight `number` conditions, and an option to input a custom formula.

> ğŸ’¡ Under every `text`, `date`, and `number` condition you can add a value or a custom formula.

Next, you have the `formatting style` tab. Here you can make the text bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, or you can color the cell's content or the cell's background.

Last, you can add a new rule.

> ğŸ’¡ You can have as many rules as you want in your spreadsheet.
