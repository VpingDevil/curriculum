# Creating Pivot Tables

 
---

## Content

Before creating our first pivot table, we're going to need some data.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want to try this yourself, check the *Learn more* section for a link to the sample data that we used.

After you have your data, click on any cell in the set, click on the `Data` tab, and select `Pivot table`.

Now, you need to select your data range and the location of the pivot table.

After clicking `Create`, an empty pivot table will appear.

> ðŸ’¡ All pivot tables are empty when first created. This doesn't mean they don't have any data, but that we haven't added any rows or columns yet.

Clicking anywhere on the empty pivot table will open the `Pivot table editor` on the right side.

This is used to add rows and columns to the pivot table, which we'll go over in the next insight.
