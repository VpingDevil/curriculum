# Building Out Your Pivot Table
 

---

## Content

Now that we have populated the pivot table, let's see how you can analyze the data using the `Values` and `Filters` fields.

### Values

`Values` is used to summarize data. You can perform actions such as:

- count and average
- min and max
- median and sum
- and many more...

This field will perform different calculations based on the source data and create new unique values.

Let's sum our `Sales` data in the `Values` field.

The table now looks like this:

Currently, our pivot table shows the `SUM of Sales` for each `Product` per `Category`.

We can further simplify the table by removing the `Product` data. Now, we have a `SUM of Sales` for each `Category`.

We can now analyze data from thousands of records by looking at the summary in our pivot table.
