# What Are Pivot Tables
 

---

## Content

Pivot tables are used to summarize the data of a more extensive table.

They are used to efficiently analyze the data from different perspectives.

Imagine your table has thousands of records, and you want to extract the total of a category (based on values in a column).

You'd have to filter all the data in the said category and write a formula to get the end result. While doing this, you are also editing your original table.

With pivot tables, you can do all of the above in less time, while also **not modifying your original table**.

> ðŸ’¡ If you update the original table, the changes will be instantly visible in the pivot table.

Some other features of pivot tables include:

- sorting, reorganizing and counting
- extracting totals, averages, and other calculations

All of the calculations are done without you having to type any formulas.

All in all, pivot tables are the best solution for analyzing large data sets.
