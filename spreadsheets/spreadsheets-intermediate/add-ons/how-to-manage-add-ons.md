# Managing Add-Ons

---
## Content

After an add-on is installed, you can view it by pressing the `Add-ons` button.

Each add-on will have its own drop-down menu with options.

To use any of the installed add-ons, just click on it and select the option you want.

To manage add-ons, you need to click on the `Manage add-ons` button. 

This will open a pop-up window which is the same as when installing them. This time, you will only see the installed add-ons.

You can disable an add-on for the current sheet, get help, report an issue, or uninstall it.
