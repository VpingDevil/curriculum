# How to Install an Add-On

---
## Content

To install an add-on you first have to open Google Sheets and either create a new spreadsheet or open an existing one.

Next, at the top, you will have an `Add-ons` button.

Click on that button and select `Get add-ons`.

This will open the `G Suite Marketplace`. This is the place google moved the add-ons to.

> ðŸ’¡ If an add-on hasn't been moved to the market, you cannot integrate it with your spreadsheet.

If you've previously integrated an add-on that hasn't been moved to the market, you can still use it. However, if you uninstall it you won't be able to install it again.

After you click on the `Get add-ons` button a pop-up window will appear.

You can either scroll and find the add-on you want or you can search for it in the `Seach` tab.
