# What Are Add-Ons

## Content

Addons are applications made by a third party that you can download and integrate into your spreadsheet.

There are hundreds of add-ons you can download to use.

These can be used for business, productivity, education, and more.

Add-ons can be used for easier collaboration between teams and promote productivity.

To download an add-on, or to see the full list of add-ons supported by Sheets, check the *Learn more* section.

The market for add-ons used in Google Sheets is called `G Suite Marketplace`.
