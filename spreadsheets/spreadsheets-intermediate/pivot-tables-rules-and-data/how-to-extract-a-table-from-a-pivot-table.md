# How to Extract a Table from a Pivot Table


---

## Content

When analyzing data through pivot tables, you may want to extract a specific table and compare it to a different one or use it for representation. Whatever the reason, extracting a table can be done in 2 steps.

First, you need to create a pivot table.

When you have it, you can modify the rows and columns to your desire. When you're satisfied click on the top-left cell of the pivot table and either press Ctrl + c (Windows) or cmd + c (Mac) or press `right-click` - > `copy` to add it to the clipboard. 

Now go to a new sheet, or whatever sheet you want your table in and paste it.

> ðŸ’¡ You can modify and extract as many tables as you want. The extracted tables are not modified when you modify the original pivot table. However, they will update if you modify the source code.

Here we have three different tables extracted from the same source data.
