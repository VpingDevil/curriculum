# Import Process
 

---

## Content

As we've mentioned, no matter the file type, the import process is the same.

We're going to import a `.csv` file that contains student grades.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want to try this yourself, check the *Learn more* section for a list of *free* `.csv` files you can import.

First, create an empty spreadsheet. Then, go to the `File` tab and click `Import`:

Now, a pop-up window will appear asking you to select a file.

Depending on where you have the file you can choose to import from:

- your google drive
- files that were shared with you
- your recent files
- your computer

For this insight, we are going to upload from our computer choosing the `Upload` option highlighted below.

You're almost there! The last step is choosing the import options, which we'll go over in the next insight.
