# Text File Types
 

---

## Content

These files can be opened with any text editor, but some are not readable when opened like that.

**Comma Separated Values** (`.csv`) files are commonly used when working with data sets.

The values for each column are separated by a comma (`,`), with each record having its own new line[1].

**Tab Separated Values** (`.tsv`) files are similar to `.csv` files. The only difference is that the values are separated by tab space.

Depending on the operating system on which the file was created, it can also have the `.tab` extension.
