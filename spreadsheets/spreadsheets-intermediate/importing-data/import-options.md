# Import Options


---

## Content

After your file has been uploaded a new pop-up window will appear asking you to select several **"import options"**.

![importing-options](https://img.enkipro.com/f284439a2d4cd2537cc6362382b838b0.png)

At the very top, you have your file name.

The first option to choose from is the **import location**. We chose `Replace spreadsheet` because the one we are working in is empty.

Depending on your use case, you might choose different options like creating a new sheet or spreadsheet entirely.

The next option is the `Separator type`. Your best bet is going with the `Detect automatically` option.

> ðŸ’¡ If you have a custom `.txt` file, then choose the `Custom` option and input the character that is used for value delimitation.

The last option is used to tell spreadsheets to convert text from the updated file into numbers, dates, and formulas.

> ðŸ’¡ When importing an Excel file type, the only available option is **import location**.

Lastly, click `Import data` and you're done ðŸŽ‰!

> ðŸ’¡ Check the *Learn more* section if you want to see how the imported spreadsheet looks like.
