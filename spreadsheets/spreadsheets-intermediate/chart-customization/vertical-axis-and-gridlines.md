# Vertical Axis & Gridlines

---
## Content

As with the `Horizontal axis`, in the `Vertical axis` tab you can modify the label and its appearance.
 
There's more! You can also add a minimum and maximum value for the labels.

By default, the chart always includes all data but you can modify it to your needs.

Under `min` and `max`, you can:
- allow bounds to hide data
- change the scale factor
- add a logarithmic scale
- change the number format

Let's also change the vertical label formatting to `Bold`.

### Gridlines

This tab allows us to set the **major** and **minor** gridline count and color. 

For this exercise, we are leaving everything unchanged in this tab.

Here's how the chart looked in the beginning:

And how it looks now:
