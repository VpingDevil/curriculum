Using the chart from the previous insight[1].

We are going to leave `Apply to all series` selected. Now, add a `Point size` of `7px` and make the `Point shape` `Diamond` for all series.

Then, we are going to select the `Number Of Employees` from the drop-down menu and tick the `Data labels` checkbox.

This will display all the values above each data point.
