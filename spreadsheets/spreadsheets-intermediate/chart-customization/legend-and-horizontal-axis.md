# Legend & Horizontal Axis

---
## Content

We'll keep modifying the same chart as before[1].

In the `Legend` tab you can:
- add or remove the legend
- change its position
- change its appearance

Let' add the Legend to the top of the chart, change its font to `Sans Serif` and add the `Bold` formatting.

In the `Horizontal axis` tab you can modify the horizontal label, change its appearance (size, font, format, and color).

Moreover, you can:
- make the chart treat labels as text
- reverse the axis order
- select the slant degree of labels

For now, we'll only change the label formatting to `Bold`.
