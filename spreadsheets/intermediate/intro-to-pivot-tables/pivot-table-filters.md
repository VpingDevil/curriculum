# Pivot Table Filters

---
## Content

The `Filters` field can be used to include or exclude data from the pivot table. 

Filters can be based on values or conditions.

We can, for instance, filter values that only include the `Produce` and `Seafood` category.

To do this, we need to:
- add a filter for the `Category` data
- deselect all the values we don't want
- select the ones we want

Finally, the pivot table will look like this:
