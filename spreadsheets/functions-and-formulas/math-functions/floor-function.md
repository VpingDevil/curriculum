# FLOOR


---

## Content

The `=FLOOR()` function is used to round a number down to a specified integer or decimal place.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=FLOOR(value, factor)
```

The `value` is what we want to round down. You can manually input a number or select a cell.

> ðŸ’¡ It can be a positive or negative number.

The `factor` value is optional and is set to 1 by default. It determines what decimal the value is rounded down to. 

> ðŸ’¡ The `factor` value must be a positive number higher than `0`.
