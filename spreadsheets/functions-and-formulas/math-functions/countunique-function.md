# COUNTUNIQUE


---

## Content

The `=COUNTUNIQUE()` function operates like the `=COUNT()` function except that it only counts unique values.

> ðŸ’¡ Unlike the `=COUNT()` function that only counts numerical values, `=COUNTUNIQUE()` interprets all values as strings and ignores any duplicate cells.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=COUNTUNIQUE(value1, value2, ...)
```

Only the first value is required, but you can add as many as you want.

The `value1` can be a single cell, a range of cells, or manually inputted numbers/text.

## Practice

Finish the code to only count unique values from cell `A1` to `D99`.

```plain-text
=???(???)
```

- COUNTUNIQUE
- A1:D99
- COUNT_UNIQUE
- A1-D99
- A1, D99
