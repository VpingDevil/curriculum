# CEILING


---

## Content

The `=CEILING()` function is used to round a number up to a specified integer or decimal place.

The syntax is:

```plain-tex
=CEILING(value, factor)
```

The `value` is what we want to round down. You can manually input a number or select a cell.

The `factor` value is optional. It determines up to what decimal the `value` is rounded up. 

> ðŸ’¡ The `factor` value is `1` by default and can never be `0`.

When the `value` is positive, the `factor` must be positive. 

When the `value` is negative, the `factor` can be either positive or negative.
