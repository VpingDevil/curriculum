# IFS


---

## Content

The `=IFS()` function is used to evaluate multiple conditions and return the value for the first true condition.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=IFS(
  condition1, 
  value1, 
  condition2,
  value2,
  â€¦
)
```

Only `condition1` and `value1` are mandatory, all others are optional.

`condition1` is the first condition you want to evaluate. Possible values are:

- Array
- Boolean
- Number
- Reference to a cell containing one of the above.

The `value1` is what you want the function to return if the `condition1` is evaluated to `TRUE`.

> ðŸ’¡ The `condition` and `value` are tied together. For each condition, you should have a value as well.

IF all conditions evaluate to `FALSE`, the function will return a [ #N/A error](https://www.enki.com/glossary/spreadsheets/name-error).

Here is an example with three conditions where the first two evaluate to `FALSE` and the third evaluates to `TRUE`.

Here is one where no condition is true:
