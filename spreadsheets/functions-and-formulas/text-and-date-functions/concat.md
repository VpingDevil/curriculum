# CONCAT

---
## Content

The `=CONCAT()` function returns the [concatenation](https://www.enki.com/glossary/general/concatenation) of two values.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=CONCAT(value1, value2)
```

Although concatenation is usually done on strings, you can input any data types in `CONCAT`:
- a date and a string
- a number and a date
- a special character and a number
- and any other combination

Here are a few more examples of concatenating different data types:
