# UNIQUE


---

## Content

The `=UNIQUE()` function is used to return only unique rows of a given array or range of values.

The unique rows are returned in the order they appear in the source range.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=UNIQUE(range)
```

If we had this data set[1], and we wanted to only keep the unique value we would type:

```plain-text
UNIQUE(A1:C10)
```

And the result would be:

![unique-range](https://img.enkipro.com/2b3403e142620d932627f8673a49b354.gif)

You can use an array as input:

```plain-text
UNIQUE({
  1, 2; 
  3, 4; 
  1, 2; 
  3, 4
})
```

The array is delimited by curly braces (`{}`), each column is separated by a comma (`,`), and each new row is separated by a semi-colon (`;`).

The result of the function is:

![unique-array](https://img.enkipro.com/2563add9963c85070f207d329f0f7e1f.gif)

> ðŸ’¡ If you get a row that seems like its a duplicate, check for any extra spaces in the cells as well as formatting. 
> If one row has `"25%"` and another has `"25% "`, they are both unique since the second one contains an extra space at the end.

## Practice

The `UNIQUE()` function returns ???

- unique rows of a given array or range of values.
- duplicate rows of a given array or range of values.
- the largest value in a range or an array
- the smallest value in a range or an array

## Practice

If you had a table like this one, what would the output of `=UNIQUE(A1:C4)` be?

| \  | A  | B | C |
| -- | -- | - | - |
| 1  | 13 | 1 | 1 |
| 2  | 22 | 7 | 2 |
| 3  | 11 | 9 | 3 |
| 4  | 13 | 1 | 1 |

???
???
???

- | 13 | 1 | 1 |
- | 22 | 7 | 2 |
- | 11 | 9 | 3 |
