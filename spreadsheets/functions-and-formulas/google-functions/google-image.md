# IMAGE


---

## Content

The `=IMAGE()` function is used to insert an image into a single cell.

The syntax is:

```plain-text
=IMAGE(url, mode, height, width)
```

The `url` is the URL of the image you want to import. It must be enclosed in quotations or be a reference to a cell with an appropriate URL. The protocol (e.g. `https://`) must be included in the URL.

> ðŸ’¡ You cannot use URLs hosted on drive.google.com!

The `mode`, `height` and `width` are optional.

The `mode` is the sizing mode for the image. There are 4 possible values.

- 1 - resizes the image to fit inside the cell whilst maintaining the aspect ratio. This is the default if `mode` is excluded.
- 2 - stretches or compresses the image to fit inside the cell whilst ignoring the aspect ratio.
- 3 - leaves the image at its original size.
- 4 - allows a custom size.

The `height` is the height of the image in pixels.

The `width` is the width of the image in pixels.

To use `height` and `width` you have to set the mode to `4`.

Here is the same image with all of the above options.
