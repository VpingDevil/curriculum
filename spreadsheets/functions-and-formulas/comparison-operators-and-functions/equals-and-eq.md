# = & EQ()


---

## Content

The equal comparison operator is the same as the `EQ()` function.

Both can be used to check if two values are equal to each other and return `TRUE` if they do and `FALSE` if they don't.

> ðŸ’¡ `0` is considered to be the same as an empty cell[1].

> ðŸ’¡ You can also compare different data types, but the result will always be `FALSE`. Take a look here[2] for some examples.

## Footnotes

[1: Zero & Empty Cells]
If we had this table:
| \ | A | B |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 |   |

Then the formula:

```plain-text
=EQ(A1, B1)

// TRUE
```

Would output `TRUE` since zero is considered to be an empty cell.

[2:More Examples]
In this example we compare several data types with each other:
