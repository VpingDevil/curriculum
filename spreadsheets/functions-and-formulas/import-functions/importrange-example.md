# =IMPORTRANGE() Example


---

## Content

When using the function for the first time, you may get a popup screen prompting you to grant permission. Anyone with access to the same spreadsheet will also gain access to use `=IMPORTRANGE()`.

> ðŸ’¡ If the data you are trying to import is too large, you may get an error. Also, if you don't leave room for the imported data, the function will create an error:

Let's say we want to import this spreadsheet into our own.

![source-sheet](https://img.enkipro.com/b7b5b9b97218fd75b8279ee02679c6ad.png)

To do this, we have to add the `URL` and the `range` of cells.

> ðŸ’¡ If the source spreadsheet is updated, the data you imported will get updated as well.
