# Stacking if..else


---

## Content

Stackable `if-else` statements are used when you want to execute code on more than two conditions.

> ğŸ’¡ Variables defined in the `if statement` are valid in the scope of all stacked `if-else` statements. 

The code we had in the previous insight[1] can be improved by using more than one `if-else` statement.

```go
if x := 1 ; x > 0 {
  fmt.Println(x, " is positive")
} else if x < 0 {
  fmt.Println(x, " is negative")
} else if x == 0 {
  fmt.Println(x, " is neither positive nor negative")
}
```

If we run the program three times with three different values we get these results:

```plain-text
0  is neither positive nor negative
1  is positive
-1 is negative
```

## Footnotes

[1:Previous `if..else` statement]
