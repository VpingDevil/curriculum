# How to Install Go

---
## Content

To install Go on your machine, go to the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the version you need.

The installation process is the same as with any other program, just follow the instructions.

After the installation is done, open any terminal and type:

```go
go version
```

If Go was successfully installed, depending on the version and operating system, you will get a message similar to this one:

```go
go version go1.14 windows.amd64
```
