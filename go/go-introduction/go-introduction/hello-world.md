# Hello World


---

## Content

To create a program in **Go**, go to your editor of choice, and create a file named `hello.go`, with the following code:

```go
// declare that we're
// in the main package
package main

// tell Go that this program 
// needs functions, or other 
// elements from the package fmt
import "fmt"

// declare the main function
// of our Go program
func main() {
  // run the Printf function
  // from the fmt package
  // which will display text
  // Hello World
  fmt.Printf("Hello World!")
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ A file containing **Go** code has to have the `.go` extension

> ðŸ’¡ Every **Go** program starts from the `main` function within the `main` package

After you create your file, navigate to the same directory via terminal, and type this command:

```go
go build hello.go
```

This will create an executable file with the name `hello`.

To check if the file is functioning correctly, run it by typing `./hello` in the terminal whilst in the same directory. The output should be:

```plain-text
Hello World!
```
