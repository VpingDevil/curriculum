# Operators


---

## Content

In this workout, we will discuss how you can use different operators in **Go** as well as what order of operations **Go** follows.

### What Are Operators?

Operators are symbols used to indicate operations. 

There are six groups of operators you can use:

- arithmetic
- relational
- logical
- assignment
- bit-wise
- miscellaneous.

They are used to:

- perform calculations
- compare values
- assign new values to a variable
- and more.

### Order of Operation

The order of operation that **Go** operators follow is called **PEMDAS** or **BODMAS**.

`PEMDAS` and `BOMDAS` mean the same thing; the former is American and latter is British.

`PEMDAS` stands for:
Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

`BOMDAS` stands for:
Brackets, Orders, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

Any calculations done in **Go** follow the above order.

An expression like this one:

```go
11 * (3 + 2) - 4 / 2 
```

Would be calculated like this:

```go
11 * (5) - 4 / 2
55 - 4 / 2
55 - 2
53
```

> ðŸ’¡ All operators, except assignment and bitwise, follow a left-to-right order of operations.

## Practice

The bitwise and ??? operators follow the right-to-left order of operations.

- Assignment
- Arithmetic
- Relational
- Logical
- Miscellaneous

## Revision

Match the operator groups to their order of operations.

Arithmetic, relational, logical, and miscellaneous operators follow the ???

Bitwise and assignment operators follow the ???.

- left-to-right
- right-to-left
