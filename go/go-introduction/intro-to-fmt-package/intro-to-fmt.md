# The fmt Package


---

## Content

The `fmt` package, or the **formatting** package, contains several different functions that format input/output.

This package contains different verbs that are derived from the `C` language but made simpler.

> ðŸ’¡ We'll explain what verbs are and how to use them soon.

There are seven groups of verbs with a total of 20 functions[1]:

- general
- boolean
- integer
- floating-point & complex constituents
- string & slices of bytes
- slices
- pointer

Each function is used differently, with some having great similarities.

For now, we will discuss the `Print`, `Println`, `Printf`, and `Sprintf` functions, what they are used for, and how they differ from each other.
