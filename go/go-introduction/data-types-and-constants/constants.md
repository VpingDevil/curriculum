# Constants


---

## Content

Constants are variables that cannot be updated after they are initialized.

They are useful for creating variables that never need to be changed.

Defining constants is similar to defining a variable, the difference is the **keyword** that's used.

> ðŸ’¡ Since `const` values are constants and cannot be changed later on, it is important to initialize them upon creation.

```go
// Regular variable
var age int = 3

// Constant variable
const age int = 3
```

Constants cannot be declared using the shorthand method `:=`. They are declared the same way on the package and function level.

> ðŸ’¡ Any data type can be defined as a constant.

## Practice

Define a constant value called `hasKids` of type `bool` and initialize it with the value `false`.

```go
??? ??? ??? = ???
```

- const
- hasKids
- bool
- false
- constant
- False
- HasKids

## Revision
