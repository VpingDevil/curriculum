# Methods


---

## Content

Methods are functions with a special receiver argument.

They can be defined on types.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
)

// Struct type
type Student struct {
  FirstName, LastName string
}

// Method defined on a struct with a receiver
func (s Student) WelcomeMessage() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("Dear %s %s, welcome!", s.FirstName, s.LastName)
}

// Calling the function with 2 inputs and printing the result
func main() {
  s := Student{"Stefan", "Stojanovic"}
  fmt.Println(s.WelcomeMessage())
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ The difference between a function and a method is that a method has a defined receiver.

The method receiver appears between the `func` keyword and the method name.

In our example above, the receiver is the `s Student` struct, and `WelcomeMessage()` is the method's name.
