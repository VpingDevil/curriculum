# Hello World!


---

## Content

Let's write our first Python program, and print `Hello World!` to our screen!

To do this, in the Python interpreter, use Python's print function as follows:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

The output displayed in the shell should be:

```python
# Hello World!
```

In this program, we've used Python's built-in `print` function. Soon you'll learn about many more of these built-in functions and how to create your own.
