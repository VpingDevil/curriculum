# Python Versions


---

## Content

In this course you'll be learning the modern version of Python called **Python 3**.

Python 3 is easier for beginners to understand and is updated frequently, so there are fewer bugs. 

That being said, some programmers still use versions of Python 2.

Since you might come across it on your learning journey, you should be aware that it exists!

As an example of the difference between the two: in Python 3, text is printed as follows:

```python
print('Python 3')
```

And in older versions, text is printed like this:

```python
print 'Python 2'
```

Since the start of 2020, Python maintainers are no longer working on improvements to Python 2 and have advised everyone to switch over to Python 3.
