Now that you learned how loops work in Python, it's time to apply your new skills!

How would you write a program that would only print odd numbers, sorted in ascending order, from a given unsorted list?

Here is the list of numbers.
```py
my_list = [13, 2, 11, 18, 3, 12, 0, 7 , 9, 99, 44, 76]
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- loops (`for x in y...`)
- order (`sorted`, `reversed`)
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)

For bonus points, after sorting in ascending order, show us how you would sort the same list in descending order.

If you're not sure what to do, check out this footnote[1].

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by initializing the (`for`) loop to cycle through the list.

Next, add the sorting function within the loop to sort `my_list` in ascending order.

Then, use a condition (`if`) to output only odd numbers.

Finally, print the result.

Here is one example output:

> Learning is most effective when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and be better next time.

That being said, sometimes it's useful to learn backwards from a solution too. If that's your goal, here's one example of how you can solve this problem:
