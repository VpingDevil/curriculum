# Exiting the Interpreter


---

## Content

The interactive interpreter can be closed conventionally using `CTRL-D`.

However, this can also be accomplished programmatically:

```python
>>> raise SystemExit
```

or

```python
>>> import sys
>>> sys.exit()
```

or

```python
>>> quit()
```


---

## Practice

Fill in the snippet such that it will exit the interpreter:

```python
import ???
sys.???
```

- sys
- exit()
- system
- close()
- quit()
