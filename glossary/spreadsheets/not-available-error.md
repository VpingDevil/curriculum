# Not Available Error

The `#N/A!` error appears when the value is unavailable.

The error can also occur when:
- A formula or a function cannot find the referenced data
- You don't use the correct number of arguments for a function or formula. 

To fix this, hover over the function with the error to see which parameter of the function produces the error. 

Then edit the cell/s or formula depending on what the error message says.

Example error message:
```plain-text
Wrong number of arguments to IF. Expected between 2 and 3 arguments, but got one argument.
```
