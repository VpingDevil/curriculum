# Value Error

The `#VALUE!` error appears when you try to use the wrong type of operand or function argument.

For instance, trying to sum text values would yield this error.

Or comparing a string to a number.

To fix this, hover over the function with the error to see which parameter of the function produces the error. 

Then edit the cell/s depending on what the function inputs should be.
