# Open-Source

When we refer to something as "open-source" it means its original code is publicly available.

The software owner has released it to everyone to:
- use
- share
- modify
- distribute
- study
- etc

One of the most widely used open-source software is Linux.

Because it is open-source, there are many variations of the software created from the same source code (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint, and many more).

Another widely used open-source software is Android. You can use the Androids original open-source code to create your very own version of Android!

> 💡 Fun fact! Android is powered by a modified version of the open-source Linux kernel.
