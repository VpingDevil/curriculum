# Comment

Comments are used to explain the code. They do not have any effect on the execution. Depending on the programming language, there are multiple ways to create a *comment*:

```py
# I am a Python comment!
```

```js
// I am a JavaScript comment!
```

```html
<!-- I am an HTML comment! -->
```
