# IDE

IDE's or Integrated Development Environments are software applications used for building other applications.

Usually, all IDE's consist of a graphical user interface (GUI), a source code editor, a debugger, and a compiler.

In layman's terms, it is a program that makes it easier for developers to create other programs.
