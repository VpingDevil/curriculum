# Test()


---

## Content

The `test()` method is a special RegExp expression method.

It searches a string for a pattern, and returns `true` or `false`, depending on the result.

The following example searches a string for the letter "e":

```javascript
let regex = /e/;
regex.test(
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
);

// true
```

> ðŸ’¡ You don't have to put the regex pattern in a variable first. The two lines above can be shortened to one.

```javascript
/e/.test(
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
);

// true
```
