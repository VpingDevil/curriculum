# Instagram Username


---

## Content

Rules for an Instagram username:

- An Instagram username is limited to 30 characters and must contain only **letters**, **numbers**, **periods**, and **underscores**.
- It cannot start or end with a period.
- You can't include symbols or other punctuation marks.

Let's have a crack at writing our regex pattern!

Knowing that it must start with a word character, we can use `/w` which includes any alphabetical character, number or underscore.

Next, we need to include any word character and we also need to include periods. We can define a range inside `[ ]` such as `[\w.]`.

> ðŸ’¡ When using ranges we do not need to escape periods. The same applies to all other special characters!

Lastly, we want our usernames to end on a word character.

Putting all of this together we have:

`/^\w[\w.]{0,28}\w$/`
