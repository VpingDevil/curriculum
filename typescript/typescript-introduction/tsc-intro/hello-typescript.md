# Hello TypeScript

---

## Content

Let's get started writing some TypeScript code:

```ts
// hello.ts
function hello(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
}

hello("Andrei");
```

When running `tsc hello.ts` in the shell, TypeScript code is converted (compiled) into JavaScript and a new file `hello.js` is created:

```js
// hello.js
function hello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
}
hello("Andrei");
```

Once you have the JavaScript code, you can run it wherever JavaScript can run (any Node.js or browser environment).

To compile TypeScript to JavaScript and run the generated JavaScript as a single step, we can use the `ts-node` NPM package:

```sh
# convert hello.ts from
# Typescript to JavaScript
# and run the created JavaScript
ts-node hello.ts
```
