## Content

At the end of this course, you'll have several options for the next step to take.

Here are some suggestions from Enki:
- [Python](https://app.enki.com/skill/python) is a popular language for beginners. It's easy to read, has a large community, and can be used for almost anything.
- [SQL](https://app.enki.com/skill/sql) is a *querying* language[1] and a good option as a stepping stone to learning programming languages and analyzing data[2].
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the languages of the Web. Learn to create websites from scratch from our [Web](https://app.enki.com/skill/web) and [JavaScript](https://app.enki.com/skill/javascript) topics.
