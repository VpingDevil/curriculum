## Content

Welcome to your first coding task.

Who's the last person you met? Do you remember their age?

In the following task, you will store that person's name and age in *variables*. You will also print them to the screen, using **Python**!

After you have stored the variables correctly, the code will still show an error. Something's wrong in one of the `print` functions. 

Your job is to fill out the missing part of the code and fix the existing one. You got this!

Recall the following concepts:

- Double-quotes (`""`) are necessary to store text data.
- We cannot perform numeric operations on text.

Don't worry too much about understanding every part of the code; see if you can solve it as is, but things will become clearer as you go along.
