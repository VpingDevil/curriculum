# Functions

---
## Content

Functions allow us to make little snippets of code, each for a separate task that we do within our program. For instance, we are simulating a human being that loves coffee, so much that he makes 10 cups a day. For every cup of coffee he would need to do the following:

1. find a clean cup
2. boil water
3. open the packet
4. mix the coffee with the boiling water.
5. drink (gulp, gulp)

That's so much work! Instead, imagine if we had one function `make_coffee` with all of these instructions. Every time we want coffee, we write `make_coffee` and, voila! - the work is done.

### Easier to read

Functions give the program structure and make them easy to understand. `make_bed`, `brush_teeth`, and `read_book` would be a lot easier to understand rather than a series of steps laid out one after the other.
> ðŸ’¡ You should give your functions explanatory names to make it easier for the reader to understand what they do.

Can you think of 3 other functions straight out of your everyday life?
